Other transformations are still happening. In the last five years, for example, Rupp has made considerable progresses in many areas including organizational structure, institutional governance, capacity building, infrastructure development, research, teaching and learning, curriculum development, and quality assurance. These achievements have encouraged RUPP management and faculty to strive harder to implement the institutional reform and achieve development goals.",
